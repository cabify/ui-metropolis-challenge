# Cabify UI Metropolis challenge

![Example image](./Metropolis.jpg?raw=true)

## Challenge statement

The purpose of this challenge is to see how you deal with UX/UI technologies. Try to code the design given as accurately as possible. Moreover, we would also like to see some React code in action, but it is not mandatory for this test.

The test consists of integrating the first landing page of a big project, which could be used as the codebase for many others in the future.

Good practices are important to ease the creation of subsequent landings.

You can propose the structure that suits best for this exercise, but we would like you to justify your decisions.

Our design team would be very pleased to receive improvement suggestions based on implementation details.

As guidance, we estimate that the average time needed to perform a solution for this test is about 4h. Don't worry if it takes you more than that. Use it as a reference, so you don't overdo things unnecessarily. Focus on the requirements.

## Technical aspects

- We love pixel perfect.
- Using our desktop design, provide a solution for the unfinished mobile modules.
- The solution should work in IE11, and, since we foresee to restrict the compatibility to modern browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari...) and deprecate IE, It would be a bonus point to leave this code prepared for an easy migration.
- The animation of navigation chips in the "features" module is not mandatory, but it's an appreciated bonus.
- We would love to see some basic, subtle animations.
- Probably there are no wrong decisions, just a lack of arguments.
- This code should be ready for production.

## Assets

We provided you an **assets** folder just to save you some time. You shouldn't need more than that.

The design is given in 2 formats (Sketch && Marvel), choose the one you prefer.
